This user challenge application is built on top of a MEAN.JS stack:

MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust framework to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.

## Before You Begin
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install bower globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```

### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Download and unzip the Repository Zip File. It's assumed that if you are reading this - that you have already done that step!

## Quick Install
After you've downloaded the Repository and installed all the prerequisites, you'll need to install all of the project's dependencies as found in the `package.json` and `bower.json` files.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running the Application

Run the application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! The application should be running. If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

## Testing the Application's User Verification functionality

To test the coding challenge's requirements of:
a) Create a User
b) Prompt User for PII verification -- Get User Consent
c) Store User Consent
d) Based on User Consent -- Verify PII using Trulioo API
e) Store and display Trulioo response to Authenticated User

First, either select the link on the home page to create a new user, or simply select the 'Sign Up' link in the nav bar.

Second, fill in all required form fields (all fields are required!) and then click the 'Sign Up' button to save the user data.

Third, once the user data has been saved, the application *should* redirect you to the Verification page. If it does not (does not seem to be working all the time!), then simply click the 'verify a user' link to verify the most recent user saved.

Fourth, click the 'user consent' box and then click 'Verify User Data'.

Fifth, once the response comes back from the Trulioo server, then visual feedback about the verification process will be shown to the user in the 'User Validation Results' section.

### Running with User Seed
To have default account(s) seeded at runtime:

In Development:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true npm start
```
It will try to seed the users 'user' and 'admin'. If one of the user already exists, it will display an error message on the console. Just grab the passwords from the console.

In Production:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true npm start:prod
```
This will seed the admin user one time if the user does not already exist. You have to copy the password from the console and save it.

## Testing Your Application
You can run the full test suite included with MEAN.JS with the test task:

```bash
$ npm test
```
This will run both the server-side tests (located in the `app/tests/` directory) and the client-side tests (located in the `public/modules/*/tests/`).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ npm run test:server
```

To execute only the server tests and run again only changed tests, run the test:server:watch task:

```bash
$ npm run test:server:watch
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ npm run test:client
```

## Running your application with Gulp

This project integrates Gulp as build tools and task automation.

We have wrapped Gulp tasks with npm scripts so that regardless of the build tool running the project is transparent to you.

To use Gulp directly, you need to first install it globally:

```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
```

Then start the development environment with:

```bash
$ gulp
```

It is also possible to run any Gulp tasks using npm's run command and therefore use locally installed version of gulp, for example: `npm run gulp eslint`
